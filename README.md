This is a game designed by me, to check for contraction bias (Hollingworth, 1910), i.e. to see if your prior experiences affect your current decisions. Coded in python, game designed in PsychoPy.

To explore the effect of contraction bias on audio-visual stimuli regression toward the mean in memory quantifying judgment and determine whether this bias is due to a cognitive adaptation process or a permanent, compressed memory representation.

Subjects: Adults with no known hearing or visual impairments and no prior knowledge of the stimuli used.
